                    What is nature? There is a great deal of talk and endeavour to protect nature, the animals, the birds,
                     the whales and dolphins, to clean the polluted rivers, lakes, fields and so on. Nature is not put
                      together by thought, as religion and belief are. Nature is the tiger, that extraordinary animal with
                    its energy, its great sense of power. Nature is the solitary tree in the field, the meadows and 
                       the grove; it is that squirrel shyly hiding behind a bough. Nature is the ant, the bee and all the 
                       living things of the earth. Nature is the river, not a particular river, whether the Ganga, the
                        Thames or the Mississippi. Nature is those mountains, snow-clad, with dark blue valleys and range 
                        of hills meeting the sea. The universe is part of nature. One must have a feeling for all this,
                         not destroy it, not kill for one’s pleasure or one’s table. We do kill cabbages, the vegetables 
                         we eat, but one must draw the line somewhere. If you do not eat vegetables, how will you live?
                          So one must intelligently discern.<br><br>
                    
                          Nature is part of our life. We grew out of the seed, the earth, and we are part of all that, 
                          but we are rapidly losing the sense that we are animals like the others. Can you have a feeling 
                          for a tree, look at it, see the beauty of it, listen to the sound it makes? Can you be sensitive 
                          to the little plant, a little weed, to that creeper growing up the wall, to the light on the
                           leaves and the many shadows? One must be aware of all this and have that sense of communion
                            with nature around you. You may live in a town, but you do have trees here and there. A flower
                             in the next garden may be ill-kept, crowded with weeds, but look at it, feel that you are part 
                             of all that, part of all living things. If you hurt nature, you are hurting yourself.
                             <br><br>
                             Nature provides us all the natural resources. Nature always gives us something or nothing 
                             in return. It also provides us pure water to drink, pure air to breathe, food to eat, and 
                             other sources. Fruits and flowers enhance its beauty. Nature is the source of inspiration for 
                             many writers and poets. After spending a little time with nature, the man becomes relieved and 
                             loves it very much. Nature also keeps our health good. It gives us many medicines so that it is 
                             possible to treat severe diseases. Nature benefits us a lot.

                            Man is harming nature day by day for his personal gain. He is forgetting that nature is precious. 
                            He has been cutting down trees day by day, reducing the beauty of nature and making him miserable. 
                            Due to human activities, the problem of global warming, etc. has increased. The nature that benefits 
                            us all the time, we are being harmed in return.If we take nature in a broader sense, then it will
                             include everything, that is, all those things which are near us and those which are far away from us.
